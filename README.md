## Source files
To run from source the client has to use `quoridor-client.rkt`, while the server must be started via `quoridor-server.rkt`.

## Binary files
### Windows
[Client](http://e.pc.cd/pmWotalK)
[Server](http://e.pc.cd/7QWotalK)
## Usage
### Client
The host address and port can be changed in the `host-adress.txt` file, which must be in the same folder as the `quoridor-client.exe` and `client-settings.txt`. Latter can be used to adjust the rendering size. 45 works well for HD displays, while 100 looks good on 2K monitors.
### Server
The `quoridor-server.exe` must be in the same folder as the `server-port.txt`.
